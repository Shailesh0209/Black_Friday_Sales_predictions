# Black_Friday_Sales_predictions
Black Fiday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. Many stores offer highly promoted sales on Black Friday and open very early(sometimes as early as midnight[2]), or may even start their sales at some time on Thanksgiving.
